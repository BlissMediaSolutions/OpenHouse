    <p>With just ten permanent staff there would be a limit as to how many programs Open House could offer, and to how many people. We are blessed with the regular assistance of more than 50 volunteers, some of whom have served for more than 30, and in some cases 40 years. This is one of the reasons so many people keep coming back to programs at Open House, that is, the knowledge that they will always be welcomed by a familiar, friendly and caring group of people.</p>
    <p>We are also blessed with multiple placements by students studying youth or community work keen to get some real life practical experience – usually for 100 or 200 hours. This is a triple win with Open House benefiting from the assistance and infusion of the latest thinking in care, the students getting participant contact, and mentoring from experienced youth workers, and for participants who love the variety of interactions with vibrant young people.</p>
    <p><i>“I love the people who come to Open House and I love the feeling of really helping people,”</i> say Val Armit, who has been a volunteer at Open House for twenty years, following eight years service at another Christian Charity in Ivanhoe. <i>“Many of our participants are isolated, with no one to talk to when they are worried or excited about something. We are there for them to talk to, it’s like a family.” </i></p>
