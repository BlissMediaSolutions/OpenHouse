    <h5>Our non-judgmental, accepting of all, friendship model makes Open House attractive to participants. For many we are their last chance only hope. </h5>
    <h5>The personal impact for participants, as well as financial savings for society of our programs, is huge. For example, the annual cost of keeping just one youth in detention is over $235,000.  Just one person saved through our youth workshop program gives a "positive rate of return" to society. </h5>
    <h5>Similarly the social and economic cost to society of teenage pregnancy or drug use is high. Our joy is saving and making lives! </h5>
    <h5>For old or lonely people we are often their only friends or “family” are here at Open House. We feel particular joy at being here for these people.</h5>
    <h5><i>“I love the people who come to Open House and I love the feeling of really helping people,”</i> say Val Armit, who has been a volunteer at Open House for twenty years, following eight years of service at another Christian Charity in Ivanhoe. <i>“Many of our participants are isolated, with no one to talk to when they are worried or excited about something. We are there for them to talk to, it’s like a family.” </i></h5>
